# Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio repository!  
This repo contains all of my **personal and practice projects**, showcasing my journey and growth as a **Frontend Developer**.  

I focus on building clean, responsive, and accessible web applications using modern frontend tools and frameworks. My projects range from **beginner-friendly games and UI implementations** to **advanced React/Next.js applications** and **security-focused frontend work**.

## Technology Stack
### **Core Web Development**
- **HTML** for writing semantic, accessible, and scalable markup  
- **CSS/SCSS/SASS** for building modular, maintainable, and responsive user interfaces with BEM and variables  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** for implementing modern, performant, and structured application logic
- **TypeScript** for enforcing strong typing, scalability, and long-term maintainability   

### **Frontend Frameworks & Libraries**
- **React** for developing reusable, dynamic UI components and managing application state with hooks  
- **Next.js** (Pages Router & App Router) for server-side rendering, routing, and modern React architecture  
- **React Router** for handling client-side navigation in React applications  
- **MUI (Material UI)** for implementing modern, accessible, and customizable UI components   
- **Bootstrap 5** for quick, responsive design solutions  

### **Tooling**
- **Vercel** for deploying, scaling, and hosting modern React/Next.js applications in production  
- **Vite** for fast development environments and highly optimized production builds  
- **npm** for dependency management

### **Code Quality & Security**
- **ESLint + Prettier** for maintaining clean, consistent, and error-free codebases  
- **OWASP practices** for securing frontend apps against XSS, authentication flaws, and misconfigurations
